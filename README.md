# **Linear Regression from Scratch**
This project aims to implement linear regression from scratch using Python and the Ames Housing dataset. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features, such as the number of rooms, area, and quality ratings.

# **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about houses sold in Ames, Iowa, including their sale prices and various features.

# **Features**
The project includes the following features:
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Handling missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and ordinal encoding for quality ratings.
2. *Feature Selection*: Manual selection of relevant features based on domain knowledge.
3. *Feature Engineering*: Creating polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
4. *Data Visualization*: Plotting the features against the target variable (sale price) to gain insights.
5. *Train-Validation-Test Split*: Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
6. *Normalization and Feature Scaling*: Normalizing and scaling the numerical features.
7. *Linear Regression Implementation*: Building a linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent and cost function calculation.
8. *Regularization*: Implementing L2 regularization (Ridge regression) to prevent overfitting.
9. *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Grid search for finding the best combination of hyperparameters (polynomial degree, regularization strength, and learning rate).
10. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluating the final model on the test set and calculating evaluation metrics.

# **Requirements**
To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for train-test split)

# **Usage**
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that the AmesHousing.csv dataset file is in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Install the required libraries if not already installed.
4. Run the Python script to train the linear regression model and evaluate its performance.

# **Notes**
- This project is a beginner's implementation of linear regression from scratch and serves as a learning exercise.
- The code is well-commented to explain the different steps and thought processes involved.
- Additional improvements, such as automated feature selection, more advanced feature engineering techniques, and ensemble methods, can be explored to enhance the model's performance.
